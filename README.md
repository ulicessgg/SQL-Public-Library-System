## Submission and Grading Policies

At the bottom of every main README file included in your milestones directory, you will find the submission and grading policies for each milestone. The instructor and TAs will adhere strictly to these guidelines when grading your assignments. Please make sure to read them as soon as a milestone is assigned so that you understand what is expected of you.

Below are the general policies regarding milestones for the course, which can also be found in the syllabus:

> Make sure all your work is committed to the `master` branch of your repository. Only work in the `master` branch will be graded. No exceptions!

- Only assignments uploaded to both Canvas **and** the GitHub repository created for this class will be considered for grading.
- All assignments are due on the designated due date as specified by the instructor. It is the studentâ€™s responsibility 
  to keep track of all assignments due dates and plan accordingly.
- There will be no make-up milestone assignments in this course under any circumstances, except for extenuating 
  situations such as hospitalization, other serious events beyond the studentâ€™s control, or DPRC-approved accommodations 
  regarding milestone assignments. In such cases, documentation will be required as evidence.
- Students are responsible for what they submit. If you submit a blank assignment, it will be graded as such. 
  Always double-check your submissions to ensure that what you intended to upload is actually what you uploaded.
- Late milestone submissions will be subject to penalties. A 10% deduction will be applied for each day the assignment 
  is overdue, up to a maximum of three days. After three days, the assignment will be considered not submitted and will 
  receive a grade of zero. It is imperative that students adhere to the specified deadlines, as failing to do so will 
  result in a reduction of their assignment scores. This policy is designed to emphasize the importance 
  of timely and responsible submission of coursework while providing a reasonable window for unforeseen circumstances. 
  Students are strongly encouraged to manage their time effectively to avoid unnecessary deductions and to ensure the
  best possible academic outcomes. This policy applies to all milestone assignments in this course **except** for the 
  last milestone assignment of the semester. The instructor will be unable to accept late work for the last milestone 
  assignment due to the time constraints at the end of the semester.
- Work committed to personal repositories will not be considered for grading. All work for this course must be 
  committed to the remote repository created in class using the link provided by the instructor. No exceptions!


## Grade Appeal

- Students may request a grade revision for their milestone assignments, quizzes, or exams up to one week after the 
  grades for that assignment are posted in Canvas. To request a revision, students must: (1) schedule office hours 
  with the instructor for the review, and (2) demonstrate that points were deducted by mistake. After this one-week 
  period, the assigned grade for that assignment becomes final, and no further revisions will be made under any circumstances.
